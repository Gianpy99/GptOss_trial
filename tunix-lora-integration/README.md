# tunix-lora-integration

## Overview
The `tunix-lora-integration` project is designed to facilitate the fine-tuning of machine learning models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This project integrates various components to provide a seamless experience for training and evaluating models with LoRA.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **wrapper.py**: Main interface for interacting with the Ollama server.
  - **lora/**: Contains LoRA-specific implementations.
    - **adapters.py**: Adapts models for LoRA fine-tuning.
    - **training.py**: Implements the training process for LoRA.
    - **utils.py**: Provides utility functions for LoRA tasks.
  - **data/**: Manages data loading and preprocessing.
    - **dataset.py**: Defines the dataset class.
    - **preprocess.py**: Contains data preprocessing functions.
  - **models/**: Defines the model architecture.
    - **model.py**: Model definition for fine-tuning.
  - **cli.py**: Command-line interface for the application.
  - **__init__.py**: Initializes the package.

- **configs/**: Contains configuration files for various components.
  - **lora.yaml**: LoRA-specific configuration settings.
  - **training.yaml**: General training configurations.
  - **dataset.yaml**: Dataset configurations.

- **experiments/**: Contains configurations for specific experiment runs.
  - **example_run/**: Example run configuration.
    - **run_config.yaml**: Configuration for a specific experiment.

- **scripts/**: Shell scripts for running training and evaluation.
  - **run_train.sh**: Script to execute the training process.
  - **evaluate.sh**: Script to evaluate the trained model.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for examples and demonstrations.
  - **lora_finetune_example.ipynb**: Example of fine-tuning a model using LoRA.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the application.
  - **test_memory_manager.py**: Tests for memory management functionality.
  - **test_build_messages.py**: Tests for message building functionality.
  - **test_stream_chat.py**: Tests for streaming chat functionality.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

- **setup.py**: Used for packaging the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tunix-lora-integration
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train a model using LoRA, run the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/run_train.sh
```

To evaluate the trained model, use:

```bash
bash scripts/evaluate.sh
```

## Example
Refer to the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/lora_finetune_example.ipynb` for a detailed example of how to fine-tune a model using LoRA.
